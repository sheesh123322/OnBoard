# Shawns NFC Card

<!-- My board when in contact with a phone will transmit a url and light up the led on my pcb. The url will be a link to my friends instagram.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> it will cost 3.54 for 5 pcb boards. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** --> I think the biggest challenge was using github cause its my first time using this platform.
